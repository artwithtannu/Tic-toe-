🛠️ Technologies Used
1. HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. In this project, it's used to:
  1.  Structure the layout of the page
  2.  Create the Tic-Tac-Toe board using a div grid or buttons
  3.  Define elements like:
        . Game title (<Tic-Tac-Toe>)
        . Game status display (whose turn it is)
        . Restart button
  4.  Provide semantic meaning to the content

📁 Main file: index.html



2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  CSS is used to style and visually design the game. In this project, CSS handles:
    1. Layout: Centering the game on the page and organizing the 3x3 grid
    2. Styling:
    .   Rounded boxes with hover effects
    .   Gradient background for a modern look
    .   Button styles and transitions
    3. Responsiveness:
    .     Makes the game playable on different screen sizes (phones, tablets, etc.)
    .     Custom fonts and spacing for a clean UI
       
📁 Stylesheet: style.css

3. JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript brings the game to life with interactivity and logic. In this project, it is used for:

1.   Game Mechanics:
    .   Detecting player turns (X or O)
    .   Updating the board when a cell is clicked
    .   Checking for win conditions or a draw
2.   DOM Manipulation:
   .   Dynamically updating text like "Player X's turn"
3.   Reset functionality:
.       Clears the board and restarts the game when the "Restart Game" button is clicked.
   
📁 Script file: script.js
